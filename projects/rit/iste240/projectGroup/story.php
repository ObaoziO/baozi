				<span class="story">Our Story</span><br>
				Ever since we were young, our Aunt Shawna Griffin has opened her home to us during summers and breaks from school. Shawna Griffin has always 
				had a passion for yoga and meditation; she practiced a healthy lifestyle that she passed down to us when we were young. During our time in Aunt Shawna’s estate, she would
				prepare fresh healthy meals each day for us to eat, followed by yoga sessions and evening meditation rituals. It was never a 
				dull moment when staying with our Aunt Shawna. We learned a lot of different types of yoga and learned to cook various healthy meals
				while staying with her. After her passing, not only did we inherit our Aunt Shawna’s estate, but we felt as if we had inherited
				her wisdom and love for yoga. While we were upset to see her go, we decided to turn her estate into a yoga and meditation center to 
				continue her legacy. After our time with Aunt Shawna, we wanted to share our experiences in her home with the rest of the world.

				<span class="story">Our Mission/Goals</span><br>
				One of our main goals here at Griffin Cafe and Fitness Center is to share our love and knowledge for yoga and meditation with everyone. We want to create an environment 
				for our customers where they can learn basic yoga techniques and improve their skills. We want our customers to find a haven where they can absolve 
				themselves from all the stress that they have accumulated. The values we want to share with our customer is the promotion of a healthy free lifestyle, 
				one that we inherited from our Aunt Shawna.
