		<h2> Site Map vs  User Navigation </h2>
			<p>
				<Strong>Objective:</strong> To gain an understanding of 
				the differences between a sitemap and the user navigation 
				on a web site.
			</p>
	
	
  			<h3> Site Map </h3>
  				<p>
  					A site map is a list of pages accessible to users.
  					As shown in the image below, it can be a Web page 
  					that lists all of the pages on the web site, and 
  					is generally in a hierarchal order. Another type
  					of site map can be accessible to crawlers, 
  					normally in the form of documents and cannot be 
  					seen by the user. In this case, it can also be a 
  					planning tool for Web design.

  						<a href="http://tencent.com/en-us/mp/sitemap.shtml" target="blank">Tencent.com</a>
  					</div>
  				</div> <!-- end div class="border" -->
  				
  				
  			<h3> User Navigation </h3>
  				<p>
  					An user navigation contains related links that 
  					allows the user to access multiple sections of 
  					the website. It generally comes in the form 
  					of a navigation bar, such as the image below. 
  					An user navigation is also global, in other
  					words, it shows up on every page of the site
  					and is always identical as shown in the 
  					previous page of that site.
  					
  				</p>

  					</div>
  				</div> <!-- end div class="border" -->
  			
  			
  			<h3> Differences Between Site Map and User Navigation</h3>
  				<p>
  					As discussed above, a site map contains all of the
  					links a certain web site has, but an
  					user navigation do not contain all of the links
  					within that site. An user navigation is used 
  					when the user wants to perform the general usage 
  					of the site, such as going to the "Electronics" 
  					section on a shopping site. An example for using 
  					the site map would be trying to find the "Customer
  					Service" or the "Term of Usage" page, under normal 
  					circumstances, these links
  					will not show up on the user navigation. 
  				<br/>
  				<br/>	
  					Overall, a site map lays out all of the links on 
  					a single page or document, while the user navigation, such as
  					the navigation bar, only shows the main categories. 
  					The sub-categories are hidden until the mouse hovers
  					over to the main category. 
  				<br/>
  				<br/>
  					There are few possible 
  					reasons for the differences between the site map 
  					and the user navigation to occur. One reason
  					being that a navigation bar containing every possible
  					links can be visually chaotic and disorganized, the user
  					might lose trust in the site or find it hard to use. 
  					Not only that, the function of the site map is similar 
  					to an index for the web site, therfore it is helpful 
  					to have the links of all the pages on the web site.
