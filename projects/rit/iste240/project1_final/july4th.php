								Fourth of July is the Independence day of the USA, 
								and is celebrated by firework and may be along with 
								other events and entertainments. 
							</p>
							<p>
								In Brighton, near where I live, there's an annual 
								firework showing, starts around nine as it starts 
								to get darker. There is a mini "amusement park" set 
								up, with food stands and rides. Early of that day, 
								roads are blocked, policement and security is set up, 
								so most people walks to the location.

								In the pictures below, shows the fireworks and the
