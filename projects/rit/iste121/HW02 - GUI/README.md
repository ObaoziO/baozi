#GUI from Hell: Cat and Dog

The main point in the project is to create a program that will give the user a hard time. For example, the user will not be able to exit the program easily. Images of cats and dogs are used for graphical distractions and horrific experiences of multiple images popping up when certain button(s) is/are clicked on.
